# Founders Badges

The badges we use and award people at http://chat.atfounders.com.

## To do

* Split off each of the badges into their own folder, including dev files when possible. Include a readme.md file in each that describes the badge, when it should be awarded, and gives credit for the icon and artist.
* Separate the template portion of the Acorn file into its own file.
* Move the list of desired badges into this readme.md file.
